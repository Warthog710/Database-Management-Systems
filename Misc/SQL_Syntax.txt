1NF
===
No composite or multi-valued attributes. Is the definition of a relation.

2NF
===
Every non-prime (not part of a key) attribute must be fully functionally dependent (can only be derived from the unalterd key) on every key in R.

3NF
===
Whenever a non-trivial FD (trivial if y is subset of x) X->A holds in R, then either.
1. X is a superkey of R (any key)
2. A is a prime attribute of R (apart of a key)

BCNF
====
Every non-trivial X->A, X is a superkey.
